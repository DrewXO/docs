The **Co-Pilot App** is the interface agents use when working with a Co-Pilot SmartAgent. It is typically embedded into external provider platforms such as Gladly, Salesforce, and Zendesk.

## Overview

The Co-Pilot App streamlines agent workflows, enhances AI-assisted messaging, and provides quick access to contextual tools. It operates as a side-by-side assistant, suggesting responses that agents can review, edit, and send.
