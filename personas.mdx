- Session management

## Role Selection Guidelines

### Choose Admin When:
- User needs to manage other users
- User configures external integrations
- User manages AI provider keys
- User has overall platform responsibility

### Choose Builder When:

- User manages knowledge articles
- User doesn't need administrative functions

### Choose Customer When:
- User needs visibility but not edit access
- User generates reports
- User reviews quality metrics
- User is external stakeholder

### Choose Agent When:
- User only interacts with Co-Pilot App
- User is frontline support/sales staff
- User doesn't need platform access

## Permission Inheritance

Permissions do **not** cascade. Each role has explicitly defined access levels.

**Example:**
- An Admin can do everything a Builder can do, **plus** user/integration/AI key management
- A Builder can do everything except what's restricted to Admins
- A Customer has a completely separate permission set (view-only)

## Security Best Practices

### Principle of Least Privilege
Grant users the minimum permissions needed for their role.

### Regular Audits
Review user access quarterly to ensure:
- Departed users are removed
- Roles still match responsibilities
- No unnecessary Admin accounts

### Onboarding/Offboarding
- **Add users promptly** when they join
- **Remove access immediately** when they leave
- **Update roles** when responsibilities change

### Admin Account Management
- Limit number of Admin accounts
- Document who has Admin access
- Review Admin activity regularly

## Changing User Roles

Admins can change user roles at any time:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Users**
2. Find the user
3. Click edit/settings icon
4. Select new role
5. Save changes

**Effect:**
- Changes take effect immediately
- User may need to refresh/re-login
- Access is updated in real-time

## Multi-Account Access

Users can be members of multiple client accounts with different roles in each:

**Example:**
- Admin in "HelloFresh Client Account"
- Customer in "Warby Client Account"
- Builder in "Internal Testing Account"

**Switching Accounts:**
Users select which account to access at login or via account switcher.
