## Overview

All XtendOps API endpoints require authentication using a Bearer token passed in the `Authorization` header.

## Getting Your API Token

API tokens are currently provisioned by the XtendOps team on a per-organization basis.

  Contact your XtendOps teammate to request an API authentication token for your organization.
</Card>

## Using Your Token

Once you receive your token, include it in the `Authorization` header of all API requests:

```bash
Authorization: YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl --location 'https://agent-assist.xtendops.com/api/agent-assist' \
  --header 'Authorization: YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "question": "How can I help you?",
    "aiAgentId": "your-agent-id",
    "conversationId": "unique-conversation-id"
  }'
```

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  **Never share your API token publicly** or commit it to version control systems. Treat your API token like a password.
</Warning>

1. **Store Securely** - Keep your token in environment variables or secure secret management systems
2. **Rotate Regularly** - Contact your XtendOps teammate to rotate tokens periodically
3. **Monitor Usage** - Track API usage to detect any unauthorized access
4. **Use HTTPS Only** - All API requests must use HTTPS to ensure token security

## Token Scopes and Permissions

Your API token's permissions are configured based on your organization's needs. If you need additional access or have questions about your token's capabilities, contact your XtendOps teammate.

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized Error

If you receive a 401 error:
- Verify your token is included in the `Authorization` header
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters in the token
- Confirm your token hasn't expired
- Contact your XtendOps teammate if issues persist

### Token Expiration

API tokens do not automatically expire, but may be revoked for security reasons. If your token stops working, contact your XtendOps teammate for a replacement.
