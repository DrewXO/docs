**Settings** provides centralized configuration for user access, external connections, and AI model keys. This is the administrative hub for your XtendOps workspace.

## Overview

Settings is organized into tabs that manage different aspects of your workspace configuration, from user permissions to API integrations to AI provider keys.

## Tabs

### Users

User management for the workspace.

**User Roles:**
- **Admin** - Full platform access including user, integration, and AI key management
- **Customer** - View-only access to SmartAgents, Quality, Knowledge Management, and Voice of the Customer
- **Builder** - Full platform access except user, integration, and AI key management
- **Agent** - Access limited to the Co-Pilot App (if granted permission in their system)

**Authentication Methods:**
- Username/Password
- Google Sign-In

**User Management Features:**
- Invite new users
- Assign/change roles
- Enable/disable accounts
- View last login times
- Track user activity

### Integrations

Secure storage for external API credentials used by the REST API Call step in SmartAgent Builder.

**Purpose:**
Store secrets here and reference them from the REST step instead of pasting raw tokens in the builder.

**Benefits:**
- **Improved Security** - Credentials stored separately from workflows
- **Easier Rotation** - Update credentials without modifying SmartAgents
- **Centralized Management** - One place for all API credentials
- **Access Control** - Limit who can view/edit credentials

**Supported Authentication Types:**
- API Keys
- Bearer Tokens
- OAuth credentials
- Basic Auth
- Custom headers

**Integration Examples:**
- Salesforce
- Zendesk
- Shopify
- Custom internal APIs
- Payment gateways

### AI Keys

Central place to register AI provider keys to enable usage tracking and cost/usage reporting by model.

**Supported Providers:**
- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Google (Vertex AI, Gemini)
- Azure OpenAI
- Custom endpoints

**Key Features:**
- Usage tracking by model
- Cost attribution
- Pricing analytics
- Spend reporting
- Model performance metrics

**Reporting Capabilities:**
- **Cost per Conversation** - Track AI costs at the conversation level
- **Model Usage** - See which models are used most frequently
- **Token Consumption** - Monitor token usage across SmartAgents
- **Spend Trends** - Analyze cost trends over time
- **Attribution** - Attribute costs to specific SmartAgents or client accounts

### Feature Flags

### Command Center

*(Referenced in PDF as a tab)*

Access to system-level commands and administrative functions.

## Security Best Practices

### For Integrations
1. **Rotate Regularly** - Update API credentials on a schedule
2. **Principle of Least Privilege** - Only grant necessary permissions
3. **Audit Access** - Track who accesses integration credentials
4. **Use Service Accounts** - Don't use personal credentials for integrations

### For AI Keys
1. **Monitor Spend** - Set up alerts for unusual usage
2. **Separate by Environment** - Use different keys for dev/staging/production
3. **Track Attribution** - Understand which SmartAgents drive costs
4. **Review Regularly** - Audit model usage and optimize costs

### For Users
1. **Onboard/Offboard Promptly** - Add and remove users as needed
2. **Right-Size Roles** - Assign minimal permissions needed
3. **Enforce MFA** - Require multi-factor authentication where possible
4. **Review Regularly** - Audit user access quarterly

## Common Workflows

### Adding a New Integration

1. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Enter integration name and credentials
4. Save integration
5. Reference integration in REST API Call steps using the integration name

### Registering an AI Provider

1. Navigate to **Settings → AI Keys**
2. Click **Add AI Key**
3. Select provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
4. Enter API key
5. (Optional) Set cost tracking preferences
6. Save

### Inviting a New User

1. Navigate to **Settings → Users**
2. Click **Invite User**
3. Enter email address
4. Select role (Admin, Builder, Customer, Agent)
