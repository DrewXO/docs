**Steps** are modular building blocks that can be mixed, matched, and connected together to form workflows for a specific SmartAgent.

## Available Step Types

### Call SmartAgent

Allows one SmartAgent to call another, enabling modular, purpose-built designs for specific intents or functions.

**Use Cases:**
- Break complex workflows into manageable sub-agents
- Reuse common logic across multiple SmartAgents
- Delegate specific tasks to specialized agents

### Q*

A self-improving, self-learning step that learns from agent modifications to continuously improve output.

**Key Features:**
- Learns from changes made to SmartAgent configurations
- Automatically refines responses over time
- Requires no manual retraining

### Structured Output

Converts information into a controlled, structured format for use across systems, in API calls, or as conversation background data.

**Use Cases:**
- Format data for API consumption
- Create consistent data structures
- Extract structured information from conversations

### JavaScript Code

Executes logic to manipulate data, perform arithmetic, or apply conditional logic.

**Capabilities:**
- Data transformation
- Mathematical calculations
- Conditional branching
- String manipulation
- Custom business logic

### Knowledge Search

Retrieves specific articles based on filters and similarity search to add context to interactions.

**Features:**
- Semantic similarity matching
- Filter-based article retrieval
- Context injection for AI responses
- Integration with Knowledge Management

### REST API Call

Connects to external systems using GET, POST, PUT, or PATCH requests with authentication support.

**Features:**
- Full HTTP method support
- Authentication (Bearer, API Key, Basic Auth)
- Header customization
- Request/response transformation
- Secure credential storage via Integrations

### LLM Step

Uses prompts to generate AI-driven responses — the core AI step for many SmartAgent workflows.

**Key Features:**
- Customizable prompts with dynamic variables
- Model selection override
- Temperature and parameter control
- Context injection from previous steps

### Router

Routes workflow execution to different steps based on defined conditions (e.g., conversation stage or intent).

**Use Cases:**
- Intent-based routing
- Conditional workflow branching
- Stage-specific handling
- Error handling paths

## Step Features

Additional capabilities that can be applied to any step:

### Step Simulation

Runs an individual step with custom inputs to view outputs, enabling targeted unit testing.

**Benefits:**
- Test steps in isolation
- Debug specific workflow sections
- Validate step configurations
- Iterate quickly without full workflow runs

### Play All

Executes the full SmartAgent from the top with specified inputs to test the entire workflow.

**Use Cases:**
- End-to-end testing
- Validation before deployment
- Demonstration and training
- Regression testing

### Settings

Step-specific configurations such as:
- Override LLM model selection
- Adjust prompts using dynamic variables
- Configure timeout values
- Set retry logic
- Define error handling

### Outputs

Defines the step's output name, next steps, and where results go (e.g., Co-Pilot or directly to the user).

**Configuration Options:**
- Output variable naming
- Next step routing
- Conditional outputs
- Multiple output paths

### Advanced Settings

Specialized options for niche use cases, typically not needed in standard workflows.

**Examples:**
- Custom retry policies
- Specialized logging
- Performance tuning
- Edge case handling

## Events

Triggers within a conversation that initiate predefined chains of steps:

### On Conversation Start

Runs when a new conversation begins, before the main SmartAgent executes.

**Common Uses:**
- Prepare context
- Fetch external data (customer info, order history, etc.)
- Generate conversation summaries
- Initialize background variables

### On First Generation Complete

Runs after the first AI response is generated to perform follow-up actions.

**Common Uses:**
- Logging and analytics
- Additional processing
- API calls to update external systems
- Quality assurance checks

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Steps Focused** - Each step should have a single, clear purpose
2. **Use Routers Wisely** - Route based on intent or conversation stage for clarity
3. **Test Incrementally** - Use Step Simulation to test individual steps
4. **Name Outputs Clearly** - Use descriptive names for step outputs
5. **Leverage Events** - Use conversation events to prepare context efficiently
