**Steps** are modular building blocks that can be mixed, matched, and connected together to form workflows for a specific SmartAgent.

## Available Step Types

## Step Features

Additional capabilities that can be applied to any step:

### Step Simulation

Runs an individual step with custom inputs to view outputs, enabling targeted unit testing.

**Benefits:**
- Test steps in isolation
- Debug specific workflow sections
- Validate step configurations
- Iterate quickly without full workflow runs

### Play All

Executes the full SmartAgent from the top with specified inputs to test the entire workflow.

**Use Cases:**
- End-to-end testing
- Validation before deployment
- Demonstration and training
- Regression testing

### Settings

Step-specific configurations such as:
- Override LLM model selection
- Adjust prompts using dynamic variables
- Configure timeout values
- Set retry logic
- Define error handling

### Outputs

Defines the step's output name, next steps, and where results go (e.g., Co-Pilot or directly to the user).

**Configuration Options:**
- Output variable naming
- Next step routing
- Conditional outputs
- Multiple output paths

### Advanced Settings

Specialized options for niche use cases, typically not needed in standard workflows.

**Examples:**
- Custom retry policies
- Specialized logging
- Performance tuning
- Edge case handling

## Events

Triggers within a conversation that initiate predefined chains of steps:

### On Conversation Start

Runs when a new conversation begins, before the main SmartAgent executes.

**Common Uses:**
- Prepare context
- Fetch external data (customer info, order history, etc.)
- Generate conversation summaries
- Initialize background variables

### On First Generation Complete

Runs after the first AI response is generated to perform follow-up actions.

**Common Uses:**
- Logging and analytics
- Additional processing
- API calls to update external systems
- Quality assurance checks

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Steps Focused** - Each step should have a single, clear purpose
2. **Use Routers Wisely** - Route based on intent or conversation stage for clarity
3. **Test Incrementally** - Use Step Simulation to test individual steps
4. **Name Outputs Clearly** - Use descriptive names for step outputs
5. **Leverage Events** - Use conversation events to prepare context efficiently

## Common Workflow Patterns

### Linear Flow
```
Customer Message → LLM Step → Response
```

### Knowledge-Enhanced Response
```
Customer Message → Knowledge Search → LLM Step → Response
```

### API Integration
```
Customer Message → REST API Call → Structured Output → LLM Step → Response
```

### Conditional Routing
```
Customer Message → Router →
  Intent A → SmartAgent A
  Intent B → SmartAgent B
  Default → General Handler
```

### Complex Workflow
```
Customer Message →
  Knowledge Search →
  JavaScript Code (process) →
  Router →
    Premium → REST API Call → LLM Step
    Standard → LLM Step
  → Response
```
