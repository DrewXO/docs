The **Quality** section provides tools for collecting and reviewing feedback on SmartAgent performance. It consists of three main tabs that enable systematic quality assessment and continuous improvement.

## Overview

Quality management is essential for maintaining high standards in AI-generated responses. This section provides the infrastructure to review conversations, collect feedback, and track performance over time.

## Tabs

### Queue

A workspace for reviewing items flagged for quality assessment. Items can be automatically or manually added for review.

**What's in the Queue:**

#### Messages
Individual messages with their complete context:
- Customer input
- AI-generated response
- Final delivered message
- Background context

#### Conversations
Full conversation threads for context-rich feedback, allowing reviewers to:
- See the complete customer journey
- Assess multi-turn interactions
- Evaluate conversation flow
- Identify patterns

#### QA Rules
Outputs from QA SmartAgents that have graded conversations and sent results to the queue for human review.

**Feedback Collection:**
- **Thumbs Up/Down** - Binary quality assessment
- **Reason** - Categorized reason for the rating
- **Comment** - Optional detailed feedback

**Integration:**
- Results are integrated into the BI platform for reporting
- Used to ensure confidence in AI performance
- Informs prompt/step improvements
- Tracks quality trends over time

### Conversations

Allows review of raw conversation data within a client account.

**Features:**
- Displays complete back-and-forth between user and AI
- Enables performance assessment
- Provides feedback interface
- Filterable by date, SmartAgent, and tags

**Use Cases:**
- Random quality sampling
- Investigating specific issues
- Training and calibration
- Customer escalations review

### Rules

Used to create automated QA rules that run on a schedule.

**Capabilities:**
- Select random sampling of conversations or messages each day
- Populate the queue automatically for review
- Provide random performance datasets for analysis
- Enable quality insights sharing with customers

**Configuration Options:**
- **Schedule** - Daily, weekly, or custom frequency
- **Sample Size** - Number of items to select
- **Filters** - SmartAgent, date range, tags
- **Assignment** - Which reviewers see which items

## Purpose

The Quality section serves multiple purposes:

### Performance Validation
