**Voice of the Customer** supplements traditional BI reporting by providing the *story* or *why* behind the numbers â€” insights that are often missing from raw reports.

## Overview

While traditional BI tools excel at showing *what* is happening (metrics, trends, volumes), Voice of the Customer reveals *why* it's happening by analyzing actual customer conversations. This qualitative layer adds context and meaning to quantitative data.

## Purpose

Enable exploration of customer conversations to uncover:
- Trends and patterns
- Customer sentiment
- Qualitative insights
- Root causes behind metrics
- Emerging issues

**Key Principle:** Works *alongside* BI tools rather than replacing them.

## Interface

### Chat Box

Perplexity-style interface where users can type questions directly.

**Example Questions:**
- "What are customers saying about delivery delays?"
- "Why are customers canceling their accounts?"
- "What features are customers requesting most?"

### Charts and Graphs

Pre-built visualizations that can pre-populate specific, filterable questions.

**Examples:**
- Message trends over time
- Topic volume by date
- Sentiment distribution
- Category breakdowns

### Top Trending Topics

Displays the most discussed topics from the past seven days.

**Automatically identifies:**
- Emerging issues
- Popular questions
- Common complaints
- Feature requests

### Chat History

Shows questions and conversations asked by other users in the account, allowing quick access to shared insights.

**Benefits:**
- Avoid duplicate analyses
- Learn from others' queries
- Build on existing insights
- Share discoveries

## Data Flow

### 1. Conversation Sampling
The platform samples conversations that flow through the system.

### 2. AI Summarization
AI summarizes these conversations and assigns **data tags** to assist with reporting and filtering.

**Data Tags:**
- Intent (e.g., order_status, return_request)
- Sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
- Product category
- Issue type
- Resolution status

### 3. Indexing
Conversations become available for Voice of the Customer queries.

## Query Process

### 1. Filter
The question is filtered by:
- Intent
- Data tag
- Date range
- SmartAgent

### 2. Semantic Search
A semantic search is performed against matching conversation summaries.

### 3. Threshold Matching
The system aggregates conversations exceeding a similarity threshold.

### 4. Summarization
These conversations are compiled and processed by a model to generate a summarized, cohesive insight.

## Advanced Capabilities

### Adjust Thresholds
Refine result specificity by changing similarity thresholds.

**Lower Threshold:**
- More conversations included
- Broader insights
- May include less relevant results

**Higher Threshold:**
- Fewer, more relevant conversations
- More specific insights
- May miss edge cases

### Follow-Up Questions
Ask follow-up questions to dig deeper into the data.

**Example Flow:**
1. "What are common shipping complaints?"
2. "Which products have the most shipping issues?"
3. "What specific problems are customers reporting?"

### View Source Conversations
Access source conversations that contributed to the summarized response for transparency and validation.

**Benefits:**
- Verify AI interpretations
- See actual customer language
- Identify outliers
- Extract specific quotes

## Use Cases

### Customer Support
- Identify recurring issues
- Understand complaint patterns
- Discover knowledge gaps
- Improve documentation

### Product Development

4. **Share Insights** - Use Chat History to collaborate with team members
5. **Combine with BI** - Use quantitative data to guide qualitative exploration
