Understanding the terminology used throughout the XtendOps platform is essential for effective use. This glossary provides definitions for key concepts, features, and technical terms.

## Core Concepts

### SmartAgent

XtendOps' take on AI agents â€” BPO-focused AI agents designed specifically to meet customer needs. SmartAgents are configurable workflows that combine multiple steps to handle customer interactions automatically or assist human agents.

### XO_AI / Customer Portal / Xoos

Synonyms for the main platform where users log in to view, manage, and build SmartAgents and access the Dashboard.

**Background:**
- **Xoos** - Legacy name from before XOAI branding, originally stood for "XO Operating System" and used as the domain name
- **CustomerPortal** - Older term from when there were separate portals (e.g., TalentPortal for recruiting and CustomerPortal for client-facing tools)
- **XOAI** - Current preferred term, representing the application where the core AI offerings are accessed

### Client Account

A workspace for a specific customer (e.g., "HelloFresh Client Account", "Warby Client Account").

**Characteristics:**
- Contains its own SmartAgents, metrics, and settings
- Access permissions are specific to each client account
- Data is isolated between client accounts

## Conversation Components

### Conversation

The parent container for all back-and-forth messages between a single user and the system. A conversation maintains context across multiple message exchanges.

### Message

An individual input from a customer into the AI, grouped into a Conversation. Each message triggers SmartAgent processing and generates a response.

### Background Context

Conversation-level information available to a SmartAgent for subsequent runs.

**Sources:**
- May be passed from a provider
- Extracted via AI
- Used to maintain continuity and context across multiple messages in a conversation

## Performance Metrics

### Feedback Score / Accuracy Score / Assist Score

Synonyms for a performance metric used primarily in Co-Pilot use cases to measure how closely the AI-generated response matches the final message sent by the agent.

**Calculation:**
Calculated using an algorithm that compares the original AI draft with the modified agent version.

### Resolution Score / Confinement Score

*(Term still being finalized)*

Metric for automated use cases that measures how many conversations are resolved without escalation to a human agent.

## Testing & Quality

### Eval

A group of messages and inputs used to evaluate SmartAgent performance. Evals are often created from real-world conversation data and can be tailored for specific purposes (e.g., all greetings, all resolutions) or designed as a "golden standard" sampling of many conversation types.

### Run

The execution of an Eval against one or more versions of a SmartAgent, producing results and performance metrics.

### Test

An individual message and its input, drawn from the eval dataset.

## Technical Concepts

### Semantic Similarity

An AI concept measuring how closely two pieces of text match in meaning, even if they use different wording. Used to cluster or retrieve related information.

**Applications:**
- Knowledge article retrieval
- Voice of the Customer queries
- Conversation matching
- Content recommendations

### Data Tags

Metadata assigned to conversations to assist with reporting and filtering.

**Examples:**
- Intent (e.g., order_status, return_request)
- Sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
- Product category
- Issue type
- Resolution status

## Legacy Terms

### Talent Portal

Legacy tool for applicant tracking and talent acquisition management. Applicants apply to jobs here, and the talent acquisition team manages applications.

**Note:** There is no integration between TalentPortal and XOAI.
