## Overview

XtendOps maintains comprehensive security and compliance standards to protect customer data and ensure the highest levels of data privacy and security. Our security framework is built on industry-leading practices and compliance requirements.

## PCI DSS Compliance

XtendOps is compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), ensuring that cardholder data is handled with the highest security standards.

### Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD)

XtendOps **does not store** Sensitive Authentication Data, even in encrypted form. SAD is rendered unrecoverable upon completion of the authorization stage of the payment process.

**Sensitive Authentication Data includes:**
- **Full Track Data** - Magnetic strip or chip data from payment cards
- **CAV2/CVC2/CVV2/CID** - The three or four-digit security code on payment cards
- **PIN/PIN Block** - Personal identification numbers and encrypted PIN blocks

### Primary Account Number (PAN) Protection

When Primary Account Numbers (PANs) must be stored for legitimate business purposes, XtendOps implements strict security controls:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="PAN Masking">
    PANs are masked when displayed, showing only the first 6 and last 4 digits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Access Control">
    Only authorized personnel with legitimate business needs can access full PANs:
    - Operations Director - Verification purposes
    - Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) - Security oversight
    - ICT Team - Technical protection and control
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Encryption">
    PANs are rendered unreadable anywhere they are stored using industry-standard cryptography.
  </Accordion>
